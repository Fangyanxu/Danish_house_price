# Danish Real Estate Market Analysis

## Overview:
In recent years, the global economic situation has been declining, raising concerns about its impact on various markets—including real estate. This project explores how the housing prices in Denmark have changed during this period of economic uncertainty. Despite the downturn, Denmark remains an attractive country known for its beautiful landscapes and high quality of life. This analysis also considers whether Denmark’s continued appeal to foreigners—both tourists and potential residents—has influenced its housing market trends.

## Tools 
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data manipulation and preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Data splitting, model evaluation
XGBoost – Gradient boosting model for feature importance analysis
Random Forest (sklearn) – Ensemble model for comparison
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis and visualization

## Key Findings
House prices have shown a clear upward trend over the last 30 years, with short-term dips around 2008–2013, and the COVID period. Zealand is the most expensive region, likely driven by coastal towns like Hellerup and Charlottenlund. Both XGBoost and Random Forest models identified the most important features influencing price:
sqm (property size)
region_Zealand
house_type (especially Villa and Summerhouse)
house_age and no_rooms also play notable roles.
Larger, newer properties in high-demand regions are consistently valued higher.
